        The photo below on the left is one of the blue lagoons in Iceland. 
        Traveling is something that I really enjoy, and I would really like to go here one day.

    <font size="3" font face="times new roman" color="blue">Alright so this is paragraph number two. Also 3 inches, but, it is in blue and the font is "times new roman". I hope this page is looking nice.
        The photo below on the right is of Snow Lake. This lake is in Washington state. To get there it's around an 8-mile hike. You can swim in the lake if you go in the Summer when all the snow has finished melting and the water is warm enough.
        I haven't hiked here yet but I would really like to. Hiking is something that I really enjoy doing, especially in the Summer because of the weather and also because I actually have free time.
